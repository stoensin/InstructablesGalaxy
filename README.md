Instructables Universe in Three.js

This repo contains the code for the final version of the Instructables Galaxy.

The story of the making: http://www.instructables.com/id/Instructables-Universe-in-Threejs/

The live project: http://phil-seaton.com/instructables/explorer/explore.php?TARGET=web

Please note that I've made a couple changes to the way the code here is accessible:
1) Email-an-Instructable has been omitted
2) .htaccess has been omitted
3) data.php has been replaced with the actual contents of a fully rendered data file, rather than the live script which updates it

These changes mean it may not be totally straightforward to just download the project, make it web accessible, and type the URL. This should still be possible, but some functions will not work.

The core of the project, the JavaScript in /scripts/galaxy and the processing in /perlinClouds, is untouched.

Enjoy!
